I have been learning how to productionalize ML model via Kubeflow pipelines. I used the two parts of the article from AI in Practice. 

I have fully replicated Part1 and am close to replicating Part 2. I have stopped here, since relicating Part 2 is likely to be expensive. More than $20 per day. And most importantly, I think I will not use GCP FeatureStore. Instead I will focus on Kubeflow pipeline for training and Dataflow pipeline, powered by a small autoscaling instance, for feature preprocessing. 

Part 2 of that article may still work for that purpose, only without FeatureStore. Not sure. If it is not a good guide for this purpose, will need to look for another blueprint. Will probbaly have to go through Coursera GCP MLE c9. This is where I stop.
